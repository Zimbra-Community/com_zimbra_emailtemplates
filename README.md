Zimbra Email Templates
==========

On top of the version maintained by Zimbra, this version supports:
- Supports inline images
- Supports setting personas/from address correctly
- Supports organizing templates in sub folders

** Upgrading to 1.0.0 from older versions **
On the server you need to restart mailboxd `zmmailboxdctl restart` for the upgrade to work. Existing users will need to set their templates folder again even if they already did in an older version as a result of https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108986
